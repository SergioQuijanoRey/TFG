# Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)
# ==============================================================================
#
# - From the Notebook used for *MNIST dataset*, we try to solve identification for *Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset*
#     - We're loading the data from the pytorch implementation of this dataset
#     - But more information about this dataset can be found [the official website](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
#     - In that website, you can download the dataset in its original form
# - **Main differences from MNIST notebook**
#     - Obviously, the dataset is not the same
#     - Also, as we're solving a much harder dataset, and online triplet loss has been tested in *MNIST notebook*, we get rid of random triplets experiments

# Batch size for online training
# We can use `P * K` as batch size. Thus, minibatches will be
# as we expect in P-K sampling.
#
# But we can use `n * P * K`. Thus, minibatches will be n P-K sampling

# It has to be a multiple of P * K, otherwise `should_log` would return always

# Now we are only transforming images to tensors (pythorch only works with tensors)
# But we can apply here some normalizations

         (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
     ),
])

# Load the dataset
# torchvision has a method to download and load the dataset
# TODO -- look what's the difference between this dataset and LFWPairs
train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.LFWPeople(
    root = DATA_PATH,
    split = "train",

# This function returns a `WrappedSubset` so we can still have access to
# `targets` attribute. With `Subset` pytorch class we cannot do that
train_dataset, validation_dataset = split_dataset.split_dataset(train_dataset, 0.8)


## Use our custom sampler
# ==============================================================================
#
# - We want to use custom `Sampler` to do $P-K$ sampling
#     - For each minibatch, select $P$ random classes. For each selected class, select $K$ random images
# - Thus, each minibatch has a size of $P \times K$


# New dataloaders that use our custom sampler
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    train_dataset,
    batch_size = ONLINE_BATCH_SIZE,
    num_workers = NUM_WORKERS,

# Data augmentation
# ==============================================================================
#
# - As we've seen before, the main problem with this dataset is that most of the classes have only one or two images associated
# - So we're going to apply data augmentation to have at least a minimun number of images per class
#
# **Alternatives to do this**:
#
# 1. Use `pytorch` transformations
#     - The problem is that this doesn't grow the size of the dataset
#     - Instead, it calls randomly the transformation for each image, at each epoch
#     - So at each epoch we have the same number of images, but sometimes transformed an sometimes not
#     - This type of data augmentation doesn't solve our problem
# 2. Use `albumentation` library
#     - Same would happen, as can be seen in the [official docs](https://albumentations.ai/docs/examples/pytorch_classification/)
# 3. Perform data augmentation manually
#     - As we couldn't find a ready-to-use solution, this seems the way to go
#     - Make ourselves the code to perform the data augmentation
#
# So, the **process** is going to be:
#
# 1. Iterate over all classes of the dataset
# 2. If that class has less than `K` images, perform data augmentation to get at least that number of images
# 3. Wrap it on a `Dataset` class for ease of use
