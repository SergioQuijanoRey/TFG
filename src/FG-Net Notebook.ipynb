    "- The purpose of this notebook is to provide the EDA done before trying to solve this dataset\n",
    "- Found this dataset in [this webpage](https://yanweifu.github.io/FG_NET_data/)\n",
    "- We have a [papers with code entry](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/fg-net) where we can find how some people have used this dataset\n",
    "- From the *papers with code* entry, I find the **[following paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06149)**\n",
    "    - They propose a new dataset, Large Age-Gap dataset (LAG dataset)\n",
    "    - They talk about **LFW dataset**: is the most famous dataset where there are almost no constraints (lighting, pose...)\n",
    "    - But they constraint age, which is in what we are interested in!\n",
    "    - They talk about **FG-NET dataset** as one of the most famous datasets with aging gaps\n",
    "    - So I think it is **valuable to talk about this paper in my thesis**\n",
    "- *Papers with code* says that [this github repo](https://github.com/Hzzone/MTLFace) has the best model for the age-invariant recognition problem\n",
    "    - They have a related [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01520)\n",
    "    - They use attention mechanisms\n",
    "    - They talk about age-invariant face recognition or _**AIFR**_\n",
    "    - They have a table with the results of different papers in this dataset, so **it can be interesting to talk about this paper in my thesis**\n",
    "    - They say that *FG-NET* is the most challenging dataset for *AIFR*\n",
    "    - They **describe precisely how testing is done**\n",
    "    - They say that **leave one method** is, iterate for each element of the dataset, query against the rest of the dataset, Rank@1\n",
    "    - They use **FG-Net only for validating**, they train on other huge dataset\n",
    "- Previous paper links to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04972)\n",
    "    - They tackle AFAIR with a novel approach (I am not interested in that approach)\n",
    "    - They test against FG-Net with three metrics:\n",
    "        1. Leave one out\n",
    "        2. Mega Face Challenge 1: they test AFAIR models introducing a large amount of distractors\n",
    "        3. Mega Face Challenge 2\n",
    "- **NOTE**: some papers use the following protocol:\n",
    "    - They train on a bigger huge dataset\n",
    "    - Then, they use the whole FG-Net as evaluation dataset"
